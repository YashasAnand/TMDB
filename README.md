# TMDB
Analysis on TMDB Dataset. This is to analyse the revenue generated by movies based on lot of atributes like genre,budget etc. Firstly I've tried to use Linear Regression to solve this. Since the training accuracy is less , I've tried to use KNN regressor and finally Random Forest Regressor. Random Forest generates best train and test accuracy.
